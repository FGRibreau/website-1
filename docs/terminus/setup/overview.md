# Setup

Once Terminus has been deployed and is running, in order to get started is necessary to create:

- a product with a business model associated must be created via the [Proxy UI Interface](../architecture/proxy#data-modelling-encryption-and-masking-ui)
- a tenant/product encryption key must be registered via the [API `registerTenantProductKEK`](../architecture/proxy#accesscue)
